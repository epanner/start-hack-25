## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>
As the financial industry increasingly integrates artificial intelligence into its services, the challenge remains to enhance human-AI interaction in a way that makes financial data insights more intuitive and actionable. SIX is in the process of developing its own AI-driven financial chatbot, aiming to provide wealth managers, portfolio managers, and financial analysts with real-time, user-friendly access to financial insights. However, traditional text-based question-and-answer systems may not fully exploit the potential of AI in this space.

The current problem lies in improving the way financial professionals interact with AI to extract valuable insights. The goal is to design innovative, multimodal interaction methods that go beyond standard chatbot interfaces and provide a seamless, efficient, and interactive experience.


## <p align="center"> Expected Outcome: </p>
Participants in this case challenge are tasked with exploring novel ways to improve human-AI interaction in financial data analysis. Solutions may incorporate voice-based interactions, visual dashboards, bilateral communication tools, or multimodal interfaces that provide a more dynamic and engaging experience.

At a minimum, teams are expected to develop clickable mockups that demonstrate unique and innovative ideas for AI integration. Ideally, they should connect their application to a working large language model (LLM) capable of processing real-time financial data.
